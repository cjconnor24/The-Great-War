THE HIGHLAND LIGHT INFANTRY
Popularly known as the HLI, the Highland Light Infantry recruited mainly from Glasgow and the surrounding lowlands, but it more than lived up to its title with a famed Highland lineage and identity.

ORIGINS
Formed in 1881 when the 71st (Highland) Light Infantry and the 74th Regiment of Foot merged.
Its history stretches back to 1771, when the 71st were originally raised by John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod, as the 73rd (Highland) Regiment of Foot.
It was the first clan regiment formed following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.
The 74th was raised in 1787 by Archibald Campbell, its first colonel, and became known as Campbell's Highlanders.
After merging, the regiment's 2nd Battalion was deployed to Egypt and then India for 15 years. The 1st Battalion was posted to Malta and then fought in the Second Boer War, before also serving in India.
The regiment was eventually merged with the Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1959 to form the Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret's Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment).

NICKNAMES
