THE ROYAL SCOTS FUSILIERS
Winston Churchill famously said 'it was in Scotland I found the three best things in my life: my wife, my constituency and my regiment'. The regiment he found was the Royal Scots Fusiliers, the second oldest Scottish regiment and one of the most distinguished in the British Army.

ORIGINS
It was originally raised in 1678 as the Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot by Stuart loyalist Charles Erskine, 5th Earl of Mar, to suppress rebelling Covenanters.
In 1689, the regiment was converted to 'Fusiliers' after being armed with 'Fusil' muskets - the most technically advanced weaponry of the day. It wasn't until 1881 that it was renamed the Royal Scots Fusiliers. 
The regiment fought in many major conflicts from the Second Jacobite Rebellion at Culloden to the American War of Independence and the Boer wars.
In 1959 it was merged with the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment) to form the Royal Highland Fusiliers.
