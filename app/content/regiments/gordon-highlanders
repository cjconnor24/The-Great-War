THE GORDON HIGHLANDERS
After witnessing the courage and skill of the Gordon Highlanders in the Second Boer War, a young, roving reporter named Winston Churchill described them as 'the finest regiment in the world'. Over a century later, this historic infantry regiment remains one of the British Army's most celebrated.

ORIGINS
Formed in 1881 when the 75th (Stirlingshire) Regiment of Foot merged with the 92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot.
The 75th Foot was raised in 1787, by Colonel Robert Abercromby of Tullibody, for service in India and would later see action in the Indian Mutiny, South Africa, Egypt and on the North West Frontier.
The 92nd Foot started life as the 100th Highlanders by the Duke of Gordon in 1794 and served in the Low Countries, Egypt, Corunna, the Peninsular War, Battle of Waterloo, Second Afghan War, and the Boer Wars. It also saw action in Egypt at the Battle of Tel-El-Kebir and during operations on the North West Frontier in India.

WORLD WAR I
The regiment raised 21 battalions during the conflict, serving on the Western Front and in Italy.
An estimated 50,000 men served over the course of the conflict with 9,000 killed and 20,000 wounded or reported missing.
It received 57 battle honours and four Victoria Crosses.
Unlike most active service regiments, the Gordon Highlanders didn't serve in any other combat zones with the exception of the 2nd Gordons, who were sent as part of the joint Anglo-French forces to help the Italians following their defeat by Austro-German forces at the Battle of Caporetto in 1917.
