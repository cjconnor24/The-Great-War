title: THE BLACK WATCH
intro: The Black Watch is an elite battalion of the British Army, with a reputation of honour, bravery and dedication to king and country. Their history stretches back to the dramatic Jacobite risings, military campaigns in foreign countries and the trenches of World War I. 
origins:
Formed in 1725 when George II authorised General George Wade to create six 'watch' regiments to patrol the Highlands and maintain law and order, following the Jacobite Rising of 1715.
Soldiers were recruited from Clans Campbell, Fraser, Munro and Grant - those loyal to the Crown.
Originally named the Regiment of the Line, they became known as Am Freiceadan Dubh - 'The Black Watch' in Gaelic.
Black Watch was possibly a reference to the dark tartan of the regiment's uniform, because some Highlanders thought they were 'black-hearted' for enforcing the law of a harsh government, or due to the defence against protection rackets, or 'black mail' at the time.
Joined forces with the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot in 1881. Together they formed the two battalions of the newly created Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).
Prior to World War I the regiment served in India, Egypt, Sri Lanka and South Africa during the Second Boer War.
